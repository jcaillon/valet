### Wrapping text at column 30 with no padding

Exit code: 0

**Standard** output:

```plaintext
------------------------------
You don't get better on the 
days when you feel like going.
You get better on the days 
when you don't want to go, but
you go anyway. If you can 
overcome the negative energy 
coming from your tired body or
unmotivated mind, you will 
grow and become better. It 
won't be the best workout you 
have, you won't accomplish as 
much as what you usually do 
when you actually feel good, 
but that doesn't matter. 
Growth is a long term game, 
and the crappy days are more 
important.

As long as I focus on what I 
feel and don't worry about 
where I'm going, it works out.
Having no expectations but 
being open to everything is 
what makes wonderful things 
happen. If I don't worry, 
there's no obstruction and 
life flows easily. It sounds 
impractical, but 'Expect 
nothing; be open to 
everything' is really all it 
is.
