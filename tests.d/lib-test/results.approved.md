# Test suite lib-test

## Test script 00.tests

### ‚úÖ test::log

You can add logs during tests using `test::log` for debugging purposes. These log will only appear if the test fails.

‚ùØ `test::log Logged!`

### ‚úÖ test::markdown

You can insert markdown in the test report using `test::markdown`.

‚ùØ `test::markdown **Added.**`

**Added.**

### ‚úÖ test::flush

Everything written to the standard or error output (file descriptor 1 and 2 respectively) is captured and can then be flushed to the test report (usually as a code block).

You can use the `test::flush` function to flush both captured outputs.

‚ùØ `echo "This was written to the standard output using: echo ..."`

‚ùØ `echo "This was written to the error output using: echo ... 1>&2" 1>&2`

‚ùØ `test::flush`

**Standard output**:

```text
This was written to the standard output using: echo ...
```

**Error output**:

```text
This was written to the error output using: echo ... 1>&2
```

### üöΩ Testing the more flushing functions

You can flush a specific file descriptor using the `test::flushStdout` or `test::flushStderr` function.

```text
This was written to the standard output using: echo '...'
Then flushed with test::flushStdout
```

**Optional title for the code block:**

```text
This was written to the error output using: echo '...' 1>&2
Then flushed with test::flushStderr
```

### üß™ Generic testing method

The generic way to test your commands is to simply call them. They will write their output to the standard or error (logs) file descriptors as they normally do.

You can then use `test::flush` to print their output to the report.

‚ùØ `functionToTest "I am testing functionToTest." "This is supposed to be in the error output" 0`

**Standard output**:

```text
I am testing functionToTest.
```

**Error output**:

```text
This is supposed to be in the error output
```

An important thing to keep in mind is that shell options are set to exit on error, and exiting during a test is considered a failure.

You can use the `commandThatFails || echo "Failed as expected."` pattern to handle expected failures (unexpected failure are supposed to crash your tests anyway).

‚ùØ `functionToTest "Second test." "Second test." 2 || echo "Failed as expected because functionToTest returned $?."`

**Standard output**:

```text
Second test.
Failed as expected because functionToTest returned 2.
```

**Error output**:

```text
Second test.
```

For commands that directly call `exit`, you must run them in a subshell to avoid the test script to exit as well: `(myCommandThatExit) || || echo "Failed as expected."`.

‚ùØ `(functionThatExit "Third test." "Third test." 3) || echo "Failed as expected because functionToTest returned ${PIPESTATUS[0]}."`

**Standard output**:

```text
Third test.
Failed as expected because functionToTest returned 3.
```

**Error output**:

```text
Third test.
```

### üß™ Testing any command with test::exec

Another approach is to use `test::exec` to run any command.

The command will be executed and its output will be captured then automatically flushed to the test report.

This convenient function also logs the command that was executed, handles errors and output the exit code if it is not zero.

> However, it is not adapted to handle commands that `exit`, see the next test on `test::exit` for that.

‚ùØ `functionToTest OK Success 0`

**Standard output**:

```text
OK
```

**Error output**:

```text
Success
```

In this second test, we expect the command to fail and return the exit code 2.

‚ùØ `functionToTest KO Failure 2`

Returned code: `2`

**Standard output**:

```text
KO
```

**Error output**:

```text
Failure
```

### üëã Testing an exiting command with test::exit

The `test::exit` function is a variant of `test::exec` that is adapted to handle commands that `exit`.

It will run the command in a subshell and output the same format as `test::exec`.

‚ùØ `functionThatExit KO Exiting 3`

Exited with code: `3`

**Standard output**:

```text
KO
```

**Error output**:

```text
Exiting
```

### üî¨ Testing a function with test::func

The `test::func` function is a variant of `test::exec` that is adapted to handle functions developed using the coding style of Valet.

Meaning functions that usually return values in a variables named `RETURNED_VALUE...` (or `RETURNED_ARRAY...`) and that can optionally print results to the standard output and push logs to the error output.

It function will be executed and its output will be added the report, including any declare `RETURNED_*` variable.

‚ùØ `functionWithReturnedVariables VALUE Running\ functionWithReturnedVariables`

**Standard output**:

```text
OUTPUT: VALUE
```

**Error output**:

```text
LOG: Running functionWithReturnedVariables
```

Returned variables:

```text
RETURNED_VALUE='This is the returned value'
RETURNED_ARRAY=(
[0]='This'
[1]='is'
[2]='the'
[3]='returned'
[4]='array'
)
```

### üôà Display reporting RETURNED variables

You can manually report the content of the `RETURNED_*` variables using the `test::printReturnedVars` function.

The function `test::resetReturnedVars` can also be used to reset the content of the `RETURNED_*` variables.

Returned variables:

```text
RETURNED_VALUE2='This is the value of a returned string for RETURNED_VALUE2'
RETURNED_ARRAY2=(
[0]='This'
[1]='is'
[2]='the'
[3]='value'
[4]='of'
[5]='a'
[6]='returned'
[7]='array'
[8]='for'
[9]='RETURNED_ARRAY2'
)
```

### üëÅÔ∏è Display the value of any variable

You can manually report the definition of any variable using the `test::printVars` function.

‚ùØ `test::printVars GLOBAL_VAR1 GLOBAL_VAR2 GLOBAL_VAR3`

```text
GLOBAL_VAR1='This is the value of a global string'
GLOBAL_VAR2=(
[0]='This'
[1]='is'
[2]='the'
[3]='value'
[4]='of'
[5]='a'
[6]='global'
[7]='array'
)
GLOBAL_VAR3=(
[key2]='2'
[key3]='3'
[key1]='1'
)
```

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Recommendations for tests

It is also recommended to implement tests in bash functions and make use of local variables.

While you can test a command by invoking valet (e.g. `test::exec valet my-command argument1`), it is recommended to test the command function itself (e.g. `test::exec myCommandFunction argument1`):

- The result is the same (and you are not testing valet, you are testing your command implementation),
- and this avoid bash to create a fork and start another bash process (for `valet`), which would slow down your tests.

### ü™ù Testing the self test hooks

The variable TESTING_HOOKS shows that the hooks [before-tests](../before-tests), [before-each-test-suite](../before-each-test-suite), [before-each-test](../before-each-test) have been executed.

This test is written in the [after-each-test](../after-each-test) script. The `after-each-test-suites` and `after-tests` are executed after the test script exits, thus we can't output their results in this report.

```text
TESTING_HOOKS='before-tests,before-each-test-suite,before-each-test,after-each-test'
```
