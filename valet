##<<VALET_COMMAND
# command: valet
# function: this
# author: github.com/jcaillon
# shortDescription: Your personal assistant in the terminal!
# description: |-
#   Valet helps you browse, understand and execute your custom bash commands.
#
#   Online documentation is available at https://jcaillon.github.io/valet/.
#
#   You can call valet without any commands to start an interactive session.
#
#   ⌜Exit codes:⌝
#
#   - 0: everything went well
#   - 1+: an error occurred
#
#   ⌜Create your own commands:⌝
#
#   You can create your own commands and have them available in valet, please check https://jcaillon.github.io/valet/docs/new-commands/ or the examples under examples.d to do so.
#   Valet looks for commands in the valet user directory, which default to ~/.valet.d and can be overwritten using an environment variable (see below).
#   Once you have created your new command script, run the ⌜valet self build⌝ command to update the valet menu.
#
#   ⌜Configuration through environment variables:⌝
#
#   In addition to the environment variables defined for each options, you can define environment variables to configure valet.
#
#   These variables are contently defined in the valet user config file, located by default at ~/.config/valet/config (the path to this file can be configured using the VALET_CONFIG_FILE environment variable).
#
#   You can run ⌜valet self config⌝ to open the configuration file with your default editor (the file will get created if it does not yet exist).
#
#   ⌜Developer notes:⌝
#
#   You can enable debug mode with profiling for valet by setting the environment variable VALET_CONFIG_STARTUP_PROFILING to true (it will output to ~/valet-profiler-{PID}.txt).
# arguments:
# - name: commands?...
#   description: |-
#     The command or sub commands to execute.
#     See the commands section for more information.
# options:
# - name: -x, --profiling
#   description: |-
#     Turn on profiling (with debug mode) before running the required command.
#     It will output to ~/valet-profiler-{PID}-command.txt.
#     This is useful to debug your command and understand what takes a long time to execute.
#     The profiler log will be cleanup to only keep lines relevant for your command script. You can disable this behavior by setting the environment variable VALET_CONFIG_KEEP_ALL_PROFILER_LINES to true.
# - name: -l, --log-level, --log <level>
