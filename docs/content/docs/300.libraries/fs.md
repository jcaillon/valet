## ⚡ fs::cat

Print the content of a file to stdout.
This is a pure bash equivalent of cat.

Inputs:

- `$1`: **path** _as string_:

  the file to print

Example usage:

```bash
fs::cat myFile
```

> Also see log::printFile if you want to print a file for a user.

## ⚡ fs::cleanTempFiles

Removes all the temporary files and directories that were created by the
`fs::createTempFile` and `fs::createTempDirectory` functions.

Example usage:

```bash
fs::cleanTempFiles
```

## ⚡ fs::createDirectoryIfNeeded

Create the directory tree if needed.

Inputs:

- `$1`: **path** _as string_:

  The directory path to create.

Returns:

- `${REPLY}`: The absolute path to the directory.

Example usage:

```bash
fs::createDirectoryIfNeeded "/my/directory"

- `${REPLY}`: The absolute path of the file.

Example usage:

```bash
fs::createFileIfNeeded "myFile"

## ⚡ fs::createLink

Create a soft or hard link (original ← link).

Reminder:

- A soft (symbolic) link is a new file that contains a reference to another file or directory in the
  form of an absolute or relative path.
- A hard link is a directory entry that associates a new pathname with an existing
  file (inode + data block) on a file system.

See `windows::createLink` for Windows.

Inputs:

  the path to link to (the original file)

- `$2`: **link path** _as string_:

  the path where to create the link

- `${hardlink}` _as boolean_:

  (optional) True to create a hard link, false to create a symbolic link

  (defaults to false)

- `${force}` _as boolean_:

  (optional) True to overwrite the link or file if it already exists.
  Otherwise, the function will fail on an existing link.

  (defaults to false)

Example usage:

```bash
fs::createLink "/path/to/link" "/path/to/linked"
fs::createLink "/path/to/link" "/path/to/linked" hardlink=true force=true
```

> The function uses the `ln` command.

Creates a temporary directory.

Inputs:

- `${pathOnly}` _as bool_:

  (optional) If true, does not create the file, only returns the path.

  (defaults to false)

Returns:

> function when valet ends.

## ⚡ fs::createTempFile

Inputs:

- `${pathOnly}` _as bool_:

  (optional) If true, does not create the file, only returns the path.

  (defaults to false)

Returns:

- `${REPLY}`: The created path.

Example usage:

```bash
fs::createTempFile
echo "${REPLY}"
fs::createTempFile pathOnly=true
```

> Files created this way are automatically cleaned up by the fs::cleanTempFiles
> function when valet ends.

## ⚡ fs::getAbsolutePath

This function returns the absolute path of a path.

If the path exists, it can be resolved to the real path, following symlinks,
using the option `realpath=true`.

Inputs:

- `$1`: **path** _as string_:

  The path to translate to absolute path.

- `${realpath}` _as bool_:

  (optional) true to resolve the path to the real path, following symlinks.

- `${REPLY}`: The absolute path of the path.

Example usage:

```bash
fs::getAbsolutePath "myPath"
fs::getAbsolutePath "myPath" realpath=true
echo "${REPLY}"
```

> This is a pure bash alternative to `realpath` or `readlink`.
> The `..` will be processed before following any symlinks, by removing
> the immediate pathname component.

TODO: fails to count the last line if empty

## ⚡ fs::getPwdRealPath

Get the real path of the current directory.
By default, the `${PWD}` variable is the logical path, which may contain symlinks.

echo "${REPLY}"
```

Returns:

- `${REPLY}`: The realpath for the current directory.

> This is a pure bash alternative to `realpath` or `readlink`.

## ⚡ fs::getScriptDirectory
