## âš¡ bash::catchErrors

This function runs a command and will catch any error that occurs instead of failing the program.
The execution will continue if an error occurs in the command, but each error will be stored for later processing.
For a function closer to a try/catch block, see `bash::runInSubshell`.

Inputs:

- `$@`: **command with args** _as string_:

  The command to run.

Returns:

- `${GLOBAL_ERROR_TRAP_LAST_ERROR_CODE}`: the last error code encountered (or zero if none).
- `${GLOBAL_ERROR_TRAP_ERROR_CODES}`: the list of error codes that occurred during the execution of the command.
- `${GLOBAL_ERROR_TRAP_ERROR_STACKS}`: the list of error stacks that occurred during the execution of the command.

Example usage:

```bash
bash::catchErrors myFunction "arg1" "arg2"
if (( GLOBAL_ERROR_TRAP_LAST_ERROR_CODE != 0 )); then
  core::fail "The command failed with code ${GLOBAL_ERROR_TRAP_LAST_ERROR_CODE}."
fi
```

> While you can also put the execution of a command in an `if` (or in a pipeline) statement to effectively
> discard any errors happening in that command, the advantage of using this function is that the ERR trap
> is still triggered and you can use trace level debugging to see the caught issues.
> Additionally, it will report all the errors that occurred during the execution of the command.

## âš¡ bash::clearCachedVariables

Clear the cached variables used by bash::isVariableCachedWithValue.
This will unset all variables starting with _TUI_CACHED_.

Inputs:

- `$@` : **variable names** _as any_:

  (optional) the names of the variables to clear

  (defaults to all cached variables)

Example usage:

```bash
bash::clearCachedVariables
bash::clearCachedVariables "MY_VAR" "ANOTHER_VAR"
```

## âš¡ bash::countArgs

Returns the number of arguments passed.

A convenient function that can be used to:

- count the files/directories in a directory:
  `bash::countArgs "${PWD}"/* && local numberOfFiles="${REPLY}"`
- count the number of variables starting with VALET_
  `bash::countArgs "${!VALET_@}" && local numberOfVariables="${REPLY}"`

Inputs:

Inputs:

```bash
bash::countArgs 1 2 3
```

## âš¡ bash::getBuiltinOutput

It captures the stdout and stderr of said command.

This function is a lot more basic than `exe::invoke` and does not support all its features.

Inputs:

- `$@`: **command with arguments** _as string_:

  The command to run.

Returns:

- `${REPLY_CODE}`:
  - 0 if the command was successful
  - 1 otherwise.

```bash
bash::getBuiltinOutput declare -f bash::getBuiltinOutput
echo "${REPLY}"
```

## âš¡ bash::getMissingCommands

  the list of command names to check.

Returns:

- `$?`
  - 0 if there are not existing commands
  - 1 otherwise.
- `${REPLY_ARRAY[@]}`: the list of not existing commands.

Example usage:

```bash
if bash::getMissingCommands "command1" "command2"; then
  printf 'The following commands do not exist: %s' "${REPLY_ARRAY[*]}"
fi
```

## âš¡ bash::getMissingVariables

This function returns the list of undeclared variables for the given names.

Inputs:

- `$@`: **variable names** _as string_:

  the list of variable names to check.

Returns:

- `$?`
  - 0 if there are variable undeclared
  - 1 otherwise.
- `${REPLY_ARRAY[@]}`: the list of undeclared variables.

Example usage:

```bash
if bash::getMissingVariables "var1" "var2"; then
  printf 'The following variables are not declared: %s' "${REPLY_ARRAY[*]}"
fi
```

## âš¡ bash::injectCodeInFunction

This function injects code at the beginning or the end of a function and
returns the modified function to be evaluated.

Creates an empty function if the function does not exist initially.

Inputs:

- `$1`: **function name** _as string_:

  The name of the function to inject the code into.

- `$2`: **code** _as string_:

  The code to inject.

- `${injectAtBeginning}` _as bool_:

  (optional) Whether to inject the code at the beginning of the function (or at the end).

  (defaults to false)

Returns:

- `${REPLY}`: the modified function.
- `${REPLY2}`: the original function.

Example usage:

```bash
bash::injectCodeInFunction myFunction "echo 'Hello!'" injectAtBeginning=true
bash::injectCodeInFunction myFunction "echo 'world!'"
eval "${REPLY}"
myFunction
```

## âš¡ bash::isCommand

Check if the given command exists.

Inputs:

- `$1`: **command name** _as string_:

  the command name to check.

Returns:

- `$?`
  - 0 if the command exists
  - 1 otherwise.

Example usage:

```bash
if bash::isCommand "command1"; then
  printf 'The command exists.'
fi
```

## âš¡ bash::isFdValid

Check if the given file descriptor is valid.

Inputs:

- `$1`: **file descriptor** _as string_:

  The file descriptor to check.

Returns:

- `$?`
  - 0 if the file descriptor is valid
  - 1 otherwise.

Example usage:

```bash
if bash::isFdValid 1; then
  echo "File descriptor 1 is valid."
fi
```

## âš¡ bash::isFunction

Check if the given function exists.

Inputs:

- `$1`: **function name** _as string_:

  the function name to check.

Returns:

- `$?`
  - 0 if the function exists
  - 1 otherwise.

Example usage:

```bash
if bash::isFunction "function1"; then
  printf 'The function exists.'
fi
```

## âš¡ bash::isVariableCachedWithValue

Check if one or more variables are cached with the given value.
If all the variables given already have the same value cached,
the function will return true.
Otherwise, it will return false and cache the given value in the variables.

Inputs:

- `$1`: **variable name** _as string_:

  the name of the variable to check

- `$2`: **value** _as any_:

  the value to check against the variable

```bash
if bash::isVariableCachedWithValue "MY_VAR" "my_value"; then

else
  echo "MY_VAR is not cached with the value 'my_value'"
fi
```

## âš¡ bash::readStdIn

Read the content of the standard input.
Will immediately return if the standard input is empty.

- `${REPLY}`: The content of the standard input.

Example usage:

```bash
bash::readStdIn

```

## âš¡ bash::runInSubshell

This functions runs a command in a subshell.
The command can fail and can trigger errors; it will be caught and this function will return
the exit code of the subshell.
This function can almost be considered as a try/catch block for bash as the execution will stop on error
but the error will be caught and stored for later processing instead of exiting the program.

Inputs:

- `$@`: **command with args** _as string_:

  The command to run in the subshell.

- `$_OPTION_EXIT_ON_FAIL` _as bool_:

  (optional) If set to true, the main program will exit with code 1 if the command fails.

  (defaults to false)

Returns:

- `${REPLY_CODE}`: the exit code of the subshell.

Example usage:

```bash
bash::runInSubshell myFunction
if (( REPLY_CODE != 0 )); then
  core::fail "The subshell failed with code ${REPLY_CODE}"
fi
_OPTION_EXIT_ON_FAIL=true bash::runInSubshell myFunction
```

> This function exists because the behavior of bash subshells are not what you would expect.
> This function ensures that errors are properly handled and make the command list fail,
> it ensures that we run the exit trap and it gives you the correct exit code of the subshell.
> As a reminder, the error trap is not triggered for commands part of until while if ! || && tests,
> see <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-trap> and
> <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#The-Set-Builtin-1>.

## âš¡ bash::sleep

Sleep for the given amount of time.
This is a pure bash replacement of sleep.

Inputs:

- `$1`: **time** _as float_:

  the time to sleep in seconds (can be a float)
  If 0, waits indefinitely.

Example usage:

```bash
bash::sleep 1.5
```

> The sleep command is not a built-in command in bash, but a separate executable. When you use sleep, you are creating a new process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Documentation generated for the version 0.34.68 (2025-09-17).
