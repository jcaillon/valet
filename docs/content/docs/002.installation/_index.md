## üì¶ Dependencies

- Bash version 5 or superior is required (it uses bash `EPOCHREALTIME`).
- From [GNU coreutils][gnu-core-utils]: it uses `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `mkdir` for all commands. It uses `chmod`, `touch` for the installation/updates. It falls back to using `cmp`, `diff`, `mkfifo` in some cases. *You most likely already have all of these!*
- [curl][curl] and [tar][tar] are needed only if you want to use the `self update` or `self extend` command.

## üöö Automated installation

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaillon/valet/latest/commands.d/self-install.sh)"

Here is an example command to install Valet with the options `--unattended --single-user-installation` (no interactive prompt during installation and installs itself in the home directory of the user):

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaillon/valet/latest/commands.d/self-install.sh)" -s --unattended --single-user-installation
```

Finally, call `valet` to get started with the example commands!

## ü™õ Manual installation

1. Download the package from the [latest release from GitHub][latest-release].
2. Extract the archive to your favorite installation directory.
3. Add this directory to your PATH so you can call `valet` from your terminal.
4. Call `valet` to get started with the example commands!

## üî® Manual installation from sources

2. Add this directory to your PATH so you can call `valet` from your terminal.
3. Call `valet` to get started with the example commands!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extra config for your terminal

- **Nerd font**: Valet can make use of [Nerd fonts][nerdFontsLink] to display icons in the logs and interactive sessions. You can download any nerd font from [here][nerdFontsLink], install it, and configure your terminal to use that font.
- **Word separator**: Valet usually prints important values between ‚åúquotes‚åù using the UTF8 top left and top right corners (respectively U+231C and U+231D). You can add these two characters as word separators in your terminal for quick double click selection: `‚åú‚åù`.

## ü™ü Use Valet on windows

It is recommended to use Git bash, installed with [Git for Windows][git-for-windows-link] and [Windows terminal][windows-terminal-link] as your terminal program. You can also use Valet with any Linux distribution and [Windows Subsystem for Linux][wsl-installation-link] (WSL).
