## 📦 Dependencies

- Bash version 5 or superior is required (might work with older versions but it is not guaranteed).
- From [GNU coreutils][gnu-core-utils]: it uses `rm`, `mv`, `mkdir` for all commands. It uses `cp`, `chmod`, `touch` for the installation/updates. *You most likely already have all of these!*
- [curl][curl] and [tar][tar] are needed only if you want to use the self-update command.
