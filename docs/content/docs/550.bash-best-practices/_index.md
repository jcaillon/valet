I am keeping example bash scripts that demonstrates the points I am making in this page in [lessons-learned][lessons-learned].

## üï≥Ô∏è Notable pitfalls

### Error handling / ERR trap in bash

It is crucial to remember that any command executed in a `until`, `while`, `if`, or as part of a `!`, `||`, `&&` pipeline will not trigger the **ERR trap** if it fails! This behavior is described in the [trap builtin documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-trap) as well as in the [set builtin documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#The-Set-Builtin-1) for the `-e` option.

This is also true for the body of a function or for command/functions that runs in this context where the **ERR trap** is not triggered.

See the [error-handling.sh][error-handling] for a demonstration.

> Quote from bash manual: If a compound command or shell function executes in a context where -e is being ignored, none of the commands executed within the compound command or function body will be affected by the -e setting, even if -e is set and a command returns a failure status.

{{< callout emoji="üí°" >}}
Do not call a complex function in a `until`, `while`, `if`, or as part of a `!`, `||`, `&&` pipeline because any error happening in the function will not trigger the **ERR trap** and will effectively be silent.

When creating a complex function, do not use `return` and set an exit code because this would encourage a bad usage of the function. Instead, use `REPLY` and simply return 0 from the function.

### Jobs and coproc

If the main process exits, the coprocs and jobs **will not exit** automatically: When we exit an interactive shell, a SIGHUP will be sent to the shell process which forwards it to all its children processes, including the coproc/jobs. But in the case of a script, we start a new bash process for the script which in turns starts processes for coproc/jobs. The SIGHUP is not sent automatically to the coproc/jobs when the script ends (it only happens at the end of an interactive shell session).

> Coproc/jobs will no longer have the PPID of the bash script but will be assigned the PPID 1 which is the init process. This is actually a way to 'daemonize' a process (detaching it from the terminal). This technical is called 'double fork' and can also be replaced by using the builtin 'disown' command.

We must check if the main process is still running inside the coproc or we must kill all the coproc/jobs when the main script exits.

Traps and set options are inherited from the parent shell but the exit trap is not executed on error (at least not in bash 5.2 when writing this page)! If we re register the EXIT trap in the coproc/job, it will be executed on error. So it is better to re-register the EXIT trap in the coproc/job for consistent behavior.

Coproc behaves like a background job with the exception that they do not inherit the SIGINT trap. CTRL+C will interrupt both the main process and a background job, but not a coproc.

To make our life easier, Valet only uses coproc and never uses jobs. Coproc are as fast as jobs to start and they come with two way communication channels (stdin/stdout).

{{< callout emoji="üí°" >}}
For background tasks, always use the [coproc](../libraries/coproc) library which correctly handles all the subtleties of correctly managing a coproc.
