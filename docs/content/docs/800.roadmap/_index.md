This page lists the features that I would like to implement in Valet. They come in addition to new features described in the [issues][valet-issues].

- modify the name of each variable defined as `local -n` to append `_ptr` to the variable name. This will allow us to use the same variable name in different functions without having to worry about it.
- allow to break a test without approval testing it (cancel it basically). This will allow use to run docker if it is present and make a real test for the self install / extend commands.
- Check error handling inside ifs and evals.
- Check how we can make the list component work in the main screen while user is scrolling. Seems like gum is doing it by positioning the cursor at the end of the screen always, and then using move cursor left to trigger an automatic scroll that takes the user back at the right spot.
- test with bash 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 in the pipeline (with different distros each time).
- handle the drawing of TUI panels in a coproc so each has its own set of variables for its state.
- self build has 2 modes: either build each command with the extension preprend (yg generate, showcase interactive); this is the default. Or also give the option to build the commands without the extension prefix.
- Arguments parser:
  - Make the program parser catch all global options and verify in the build command that we do not reuse the same global option in different commands.
  - Allow options to be inherited from parent commands. We can check the existence of the base options in the command::parse function (for verbose, log level, progress bars). For source and version, mark them as `inherited: false` as we only want to handle them in the main parsing loop, at valet level.
  - allow an array for options `--file 1 --file 2` -> `files=(1 2)` `--file <files*>`
- add a global --edit option to edit the command function file
- for the showcase, actually build a small app like a git conventional commit tool.
- prompt:
  - Finish prompt and interactive functions: prompt user for multiline text (doable with by just implementing a good _PROMPT_CALLBACK_FUNCTION_ON_ITEM_DISPLAY)
  - Prompt user for multi select.
  - Add a full screen view with the keyboard shortcuts in edit mode (new interactive::showFullScreenHelp ?).
- fzf:
  - draw in a given rectangle, we handle full screen or not before calling sfzf
- main menu:
  - add info of the extension from which a command comes from
  - in the menu we can filter by extension (and we see the extension of a command)
- When calling `valet extension-name`, it should show the commands of the extension.
- test the "sudo" feature: it runs the command by forking. We could add an option to instead rerun valet with sudo.
- Add full support for interactive mode:
  - prompt the user in the scrolling terminal. Then we add an option to instead open a full screen editor.
- In benchmark, with debug mode on, we can compute the time spent on each line of a function. See extdebug shopt.
- add snippets for the esc codes. Add snippets on the global variables.
- Demo with ascii cinema: https://asciinema.org. Put the showcase in the index page instead.
- Revamp self build:
  - add more checks on command definition
  - Filter build command for `commands.d` directory
  - we split the commands file into several one, per extension, so we don't have to load everything immediately
- Tests:
  - add an option to display the received outputs markdown instead of comparing (or in addition to comparing). We can add our own function to display a markdown file.
  - self-add-test
  - propagate the set -x in self test subshells to have profiling enabled. We can create a new method in lib-profiler to profiler::reapply.
  - document the test; use the lib-test test as an example, and also link to the test:: lib.
- for major version and breaking changes, we can add a lib `compat-x.x` which can be sourced by functions and declares functions as in version x.x.
- Add HOW TO documentation:
  - how to build and share a CLI application with Valet
  - how to use valet from your bash prompt
  - how to use valet in your existing scripts
- For dropdown with a set list of options, we can verify that the input value is one of the expected value.
- For argument and option autocompletion, accept any multiline string that will be eval and that should set REPLY_ARRAY with the list of possible completion.
- Generate an autocompletion script for bash and zsh.
- Add a command `self package` that build the user commands into a single script file. We want to add options to the build command so we can exclude some commands. It will include all source required and try to minify the bash script. In addition, we can rebrand *valet* into another name.
- add valet in brew
- add man page for valet
- Allow self release to release extensions.
- Prompt improvements:
  - handle shift + arrows to highlight text
  - add a stack for kill/yank
  - add a stack for undo/redo
- add a new command self diagnostic that will run a series of tests to check the environment and help figure out what's wrong.
- add a yaml library for basic parsing. Same for json
- Implement tests that are only run with -e flag and where we test system specific stuff, like the windows library and fs::createLink, absolute path with real path etc...
- Add documentation pages for each built in commands. Add an option --markdown to the help command to output the help in markdown.
- Add an option to enter interactive debug mode when an error occurs and on each log::print call.
- Add a function to display a table, use it for benchmark.
- Add a function to display a text using figlet fonts.
- Modify self install: at the moment we count on the fact that some functions will still exist in valet after an update. The simplest is to redownload the self install script and run it again.
