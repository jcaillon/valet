This page lists the features that I would like to implement in Valet. They come in addition to new features described in the [issues][valet-issues].

- Add `valet.cmd` to the package, in self setup we can optionally add the valet install dir to the windows PATH + add VALET_WIN_BASH + VALET_WIN_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY.
- Use a VALET_CONFIG_VERBOSE_LOG_PATTERN as default when -v/-w is used. Add the patterns: <sourceFile>, <elapsedTime>, <elapsedTimeSinceLastLog>
- coproc: make sure we see any issue happening in the background
- in performance tip, document the use of -n
- self build has 2 modes: either build each command with the extension preprend (yg generate, showcase interactive); this is the default. Or also give the option to build the commands without the extension prefix.
- conditionally show global options because they take too much space
- add a global --edit option to edit the command function file
- for the showcase, actually build a small app like a git conventional commit tool.
- prompt:
  - Finish prompt and interactive functions: prompt user for multiline text (doable with by just implementing a good _PROMPT_CALLBACK_FUNCTION_ON_ITEM_DISPLAY)
  - Prompt user for multi select.
  - Add a full screen view with the keyboard shortcuts in edit mode (new interactive::showFullScreenHelp ?).
- fzf: 
  - draw in a given rectangle, we handle full screen or not before calling sfzf
- main menu:
  - add info of the extension from which a command comes from
  - in the menu we can filter by extension (and we see the extension of a command)
- When calling `valet extension-name`, it should show the commands of the extension.
- test the "sudo" feature: it runs the command by forking. We could add an option to instead rerun valet with sudo.
- Add full support for interactive mode:
  - prompt the user in the scrolling terminal. Then we add an option to instead open a full screen editor.
- In benchmark, with debug mode on, we can compute the time spent on each line of a function. See extdebug shopt.
- add snippets for the esc codes. Add snippets on the global variables.
- Demo with ascii cinema: https://asciinema.org. Put the showcase in the index page instead.
- For all the optional arguments of exported functions, allow to set them using a global variable `_OPTION_*` in addition to the positional argument. Add this in the documentation about functions.
- allow an array for options `--file 1 --file 2` -> `files=(1 2)` `--file <files*>`
- Revamp self build:
  - add more checks on command definition
  - Filter build command for `commands.d` directory
  - we split the commands file into several one, per extension, so we don't have to load everything immediately
- Tests:
  - self-add-test
  - propagate the set -x in self test subshells to have profiling enabled. We can create a new method in lib-profiler to profiler::reapply.
  - document the test; use the lib-test test as an example, and also link to the test:: lib.
- for major version and breaking changes, we can add a lib `compat-x.x` which can be sourced by functions and declares functions as in version x.x.
- Add HOW TO documentation:
  - how to build and share a CLI application with Valet
  - how to use valet from your bash prompt
  - how to use valet in your existing scripts
- For dropdown with a set list of options, we can verify that the input value is one of the expected value.
- For argument and option autocompletion, accept any multiline string that will be eval and that should set RETURNED_ARRAY with the list of possible completion.
- Generate an autocompletion script for bash and zsh.
- Add a command `self package` that build the user commands into a single script file. We want to add options to the build command so we can exclude some commands. It will include all source required and try to minify the bash script. In addition, we can rebrand *valet* into another name.
- add valet in brew
- add man page for valet
- Allow self release to release extensions.
- Prompt improvements:
  - handle shift + arrows to highlight text
  - add a stack for kill/yank
  - add a stack for undo/redo
- add a new command self diagnostic that will run a series of tests to check the environment and help figure out what's wrong.
- add a yaml library for basic parsing. Same for json
- Implement tests that are only run with -e flag and where we test system specific stuff, like the windows library and fs::createLink, absolute path with real path etc...
- Add documentation pages for each built in commands. Add an option --markdown to the help command to output the help in markdown.
- Add an option to enter interactive debug mode when an error occurs and on each log::print call.
