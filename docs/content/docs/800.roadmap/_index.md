This page lists the features that I would like to implement in Valet. They come in addition to new features described in the [issues][valet-issues].

- Refactor the logging functions to be more readable, see if we really need to precalculate them or if we can just compute on the fly.
- Finish prompt and interactive functions: prompt user for multiline text. Prompt user for multi select.
- core::checkParseResults typo...
- Add a full screen view with the keyboard shortcuts in edit mode (new interactive::showFullScreenHelp ?).
- In benchmark, with debug mode on, we can compute the time spent on each line of a function (+ try to improve the fuzzy filter sort).
- add snippets for the Ansi codes. Add snippets on the global variables.
- check usage of array::fuzzyFilterSort and add back the colors.
- Demo with ascii cinema: https://asciinema.org.
- For all the optional arguments of exported functions, allow to set them using a global variable `_OPTION_*` in addition to the positional argument. Add this in the documentation about functions.
- allow an array for options `--file 1 --file 2` -> `files=(1 2)` `--file <files*>`
- make `source` able to source multiple libraries that are called the same.
- add-test
- Filter build command for `commands.d` ?
- Add HOW TO documentation:
  - how to build and share a CLI application with Valet
  - how to use valet from your bash prompt
  - how to use valet in your existing scripts
- Add full support for interactive mode.
- For dropdown with a set list of options, we can verify that the input value is one of the expected value.
- For argument and option autocompletion, accept any multiline string that will be eval and that should set RETURNED_ARRAY with the list of possible completion.
- Generate an autocompletion script for bash and zsh.
- Add a command `self package` that build the user commands into a single script file. We want to add options to the build command so we can exclude some commands. It will include all source required and try to minify the bash script. In addition, we can rebrand *valet* into another name.
- Betters checks in self build!
- A command can declare dependencies to auto check if some tools are installed before running the command. Add `self download-dependencies` and `self check-dependencies` commands. Dependencies should not be checked/download in each command. Add a hint to play the commands if a tool is missing (exception caught).
- add valet in brew
- add man page for valet
- functions:
  - head / tail from file.
  - test if folder is writeable
  - Implement regex replace in pure bash.
- Add `valet.cmd` to the package, in self setup we can optionally add the valet install dir to the windows PATH.
- Also export user defined functions.
- Allow self release to release extensions.
- Prompt improvements:
  - handle shift + arrows to highlight text
  - add a stack for kill/yank
  - add a stack for undo/redo
