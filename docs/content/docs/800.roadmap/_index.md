This page lists the features that I would like to implement in Valet. They come in addition to new features described in the [issues][valet-issues].

- document somewhere about grouping option letters
- fix option parsing for self build
- Improve the self install script / check for updates by comparing the version number / suggest the user to git pull the repositories existing under .valet.d. Also add snippets and all functions...
  - rebuild
  - add path to valet on windows as well
- Add full support for interactive mode.
- For dropdown with a set list of options, we can verify that the input value is one of the expected value.
- Generate an autocompletion script for bash and zsh.
- Self-command to create a new command interactively.
- Create a valet-community-commands where everyone can contribute to new default commands for Valet.
- head / tail from file.
- Add a command self package that build the user commands into a single script file.
- fix running tests with verbose mode on.
- Have a consistent look and feel for interactive functions.
- Reimplement usage of main::sortCommands / main::addLastChoice.
- Implement regex replace in pure bash.
- Betters checks in self build!
- Support alternative single comments `### VALET COMMAND` instead of multiline comments for command declaration (see we can have help in autocompletion).
- A command can declare dependencies to auto check if some tools are installed before running the command.
- Add test:: and also add a snippet to create a new function.
- add valet in brew
- For argument and option autocompletion, accept any multiline string that will be eval and that should set RETURNED_ARRAY with the list of possible completion.
