This page lists the features that I would like to implement in Valet. They come in addition to new features described in the [issues][valet-issues].

- Add a command to setup a git repo as a Valet commands dir
- Add full support for interactive mode.
- For dropdown with a set list of options, we can verify that the input value is one of the expected value.
- Generate an autocompletion script for bash and zsh.
- Self-command to create a new command interactively.
- Create a valet-community-commands where everyone can contribute to new default commands for Valet.
- Add a command self package that build the user commands into a single script file.
- fix running tests with verbose mode on.
- Betters checks in self build!
- A command can declare dependencies to auto check if some tools are installed before running the command.
- add valet in brew
- add man page for valet
- For argument and option autocompletion, accept any multiline string that will be eval and that should set RETURNED_ARRAY with the list of possible completion.
- allow to do that: `eval "$(valet self uninstall)"` to clean everything up
- functions:
  - head / tail from file.
  - test if folder is writeable
  - Implement regex replace in pure bash.
