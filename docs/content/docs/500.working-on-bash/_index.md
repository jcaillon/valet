## üßë‚Äçüíª VS Code

I work with [VS code]((https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) and [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) on Windows.

WSL and the GitHub actions allow me to test Valet on different Linux distributions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

After [creating a new extension](../new-extensions), you can open the extension directory as a workspace on vscode.

It will come pre-configured with vscode snippets, settings, and extension recommendations.

### üß© Extensions

Here is a list of recommended extensions to work on bash scripts:

- [Bash IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mads-hartmann.bash-ide-vscode)
- [Debug bash scripts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rogalmic.bash-debug)
- [Shell Script Command Completion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tetradresearch.vscode-h2o)
- [Better comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)
- [Better shellscript syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeff-hykin.better-shellscript-syntax)
- [Code spell checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)

- [Snippets for shebang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rpinski.shebang-snippets)

A more up-to-date list can be found in [extensions.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaillon/valet/refs/heads/latest/extras/.vscode/extensions.json).

> [!TIP] Dependencies
> For those extensions to work, you will need to install: [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh#shfmt), [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).

### üÜé Autocompletion on Valet library functions

You can use the Valet [vscode snippets](https://github.com/jcaillon/valet/blob/latest/extras/valet.code-snippets) which should already be present in your extension directory. If not, you can setup your directory with `valet self extend .`.

Additionally, the already configured `.vscode/settings.json` will contain the following settings:

```json
{
  "bashIde.globPattern": "**/@(lib-*|commands.d/*.sh)",
  "bashIde.includeAllWorkspaceSymbols": true,
  "terminal.integrated.wordSeparators": " ()[]{}',\"`‚îÄ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äú‚Äù|‚åú‚åù"
}
```

It will allow you to navigate to the function definitions with `F12` and `Ctrl+click` on the function calls.

You should have autocompletion and help on all ibrary functions:

### üëÆ shellcheck

If you have installed the recommended extensions, you will also have shellcheck which will attempt to following the sourced files in your project. You should annotate each `source` statement for shellcheck to use the `lib-valet` file:

```bash
# shellcheck source=../lib-valet
source string
```
