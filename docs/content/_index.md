Valet in a gist:

- In Valet, you can create new **commands** that you can invoke with `valet my-command`.
- Each command has properties that describe it (a description, a list of arguments and options, and so on...).
- Each command has an associated bash function that is called when the command is invoked and which contains your logic.
- You define commands and their functions in `.sh` files under your Valet user directory and Valet takes care of indexing your commands; which allows you to quickly find them, parse options, arguments, print their help...
- Commands are packaged in **extensions** that can easily be shared and downloaded by other Valet users.

## üñ•Ô∏è An interactive menu

Calling `valet` without arguments lets you interactively search commands, read their documentation and execute them:

{{< asciicinema file="interactive-menu" >}}

## ‚ú® Create a command

[Command properties](./docs/command-properties/) are defined using a simple YAML syntax:

```bash {linenos=table,linenostart=1,filename="showcase-command1.sh"}
#!/usr/bin/env bash
: <<"COMMAND_YAML"
command: showcase command1
function: showcaseCommand1
shortDescription: A showcase command that uses arguments and options.
description: |-
  An example of description.

  You can put any text here, it will be wrapped to fit the terminal width.

  You can ‚åúhighlight‚åù some text as well.
arguments:
- name: first-arg
  description: |-
    First argument.
- name: more...
  description: |-
    Will be an an array of strings.
options:
- name: -o, --option1
  description: |-
    First option.
  noEnvironmentVariable: true
- name: -2, --this-is-option2 <level>
  description: |-
    An option with a value.
  default: two
examples:
- name: showcase command1 -o -2 value1 arg1 more1 more2
  description: |-
    Call command1 with option1, option2 and some arguments.
COMMAND_YAML
function showcaseCommand1() {
  :
}
```

## üìñ Clear and standardized help

With `valet command --help` or `valet help command`, you get a beautifully formatted help for your command:

{{< asciicinema file="show-help" >}}

## ü™Ñ Automatic parsing of arguments and options

Positional arguments and options are automatically parsed by Valet based on your command definition.

They are made available as local variables in your command function.

```bash {linenos=table,linenostart=1,filename="showcase-command1.sh"}
#!/usr/bin/env bash
: <<"COMMAND_YAML"
command: showcase command1
function: showcaseCommand1
shortDescription: A showcase command that uses arguments and options.

  description: |-
    Call command1 with option1, option2 and some arguments.
COMMAND_YAML
function showcaseCommand1() {
  command::parseArguments "$@"; eval "${REPLY}"
  command::checkParsedResults

  log::info "First argument: ${firstArg}."
  log::info "Option 1: ${option1}."
  log::info "Option 2: ${thisIsOption2}."
  log::info "More: ${more[*]}."

  # example use of a library function
  # Importing the string library (note that we could also do that at the beginning of the script)
  include string
  local myString="<b>My bold text</b>"
  string::extractBetween myString "<b>" "</b>"
  log::info "Extracted text is: ‚åú${REPLY}‚åù"

  echo "That's it!"
}
```

## üêæ Advanced logging

Easily log messages and [customize their output](./docs/configuration/#-log-configuration) on the fly.

```bash {linenos=table,linenostart=1,filename="test-log.sh"}

: <<"COMMAND_YAML"
command: test-log
function: testLog
shortDescription: A command that only for testing valet logging functions.

  A command that only for testing valet logging functions.
COMMAND_YAML
function testLog() {
  log::errorTrace "This is an error trace message which is always displayed."
  log::trace "This is a trace message."
  log::debug "This is a debug message."
  log::info "This is an info message with a super long sentence. Notice how the line gets wrapped and indented correctly to increase readability."
  log::success "This is a success message."
  log::warning "This is a warning message."$'\n'"With a second line."
  log::error "This is an error message, also shows the callstack with debug level."
  if log::isDebugEnabled; then
    log::printString "The debug mode is activated!"
  fi
  if log::isTraceEnabled; then
    log::printString "The trace mode is activated!"
  fi
}
```

## üß™ Test framework

[Automate tests](./docs/new-tests/) for your script using the approval tests approach for assertions:

{{< asciicinema file="tests" >}}

## üß© Libraries of functions

Make your scripts more performant and write code faster by using [Valet standard libraries][libraries-link] for string manipulation, interactive prompt, pure bash I/O and more...

Use one of the **{{% stats "nbFunctions" %}} functions coming in standard** with Valet! Some examples:

```bash {linenos=table,linenostart=1,filename="script.sh"}
myFunction() {
  include string interactive

  local myString="field1 field2 field3"
  string::getField myString 1 separator=" "
  echo "The field at index 1 is ${REPLY}"

  if interactive::promptYesNo "Do you want to continue?"; then 
    echo "Yes."
  else
    echo "No."
  fi
}
```
